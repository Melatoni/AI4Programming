int` and "strings" (which are typically `char*` or `char[]`). You would need a `union` or a `struct` with a tag to represent such mixed data, but sorting heterogeneous types requires a comparison function that knows how to compare integers with strings, which is not a standard operation and would be highly dependent on the chosen representation.

2.  **"Strings" in Pure C/ACSL:** Without `<string.h>`, string manipulation (comparison, length) becomes complex. A "string" would be a `char*` terminated by `\0`. Comparing them lexicographically would require manual iteration.

3.  **Sorting Algorithm:** A comparison-based sort (like bubble sort, quicksort, mergesort) requires a well-defined comparison function. For mixed types, this comparison function is the core challenge. For example, should `5` come before or after `"apple"`? And `5` vs `"10"`?

4.  **Frama-C/WP Limitations for Complex Data Structures:** While Frama-C can handle pointers and structs, proving properties about generic sorting of complex, user-defined heterogeneous types is significantly harder than sorting basic types like `int`. The properties for "sorted" would need to be defined not just on values but also on types.

**Conclusion:**

Given the strict constraints, especially "No Standard Libraries" and the requirement to use `int` for booleans, representing and sorting a "mixed list of integers and strings" is not feasible in a way that can be reasonably verified by Frama-C/WP without making significant, non-trivial assumptions about the data representation and comparison logic that are outside the scope of a typical Frama-C exercise.

**To make this problem solvable within the Frama-C/ACSL context, clarification is needed on:**

*   **How the "mixed list" is represented in C.** (e.g., an array of `struct { int type; union { int i; char* s; } data; }`?)
*   **The comparison logic for mixed types.** (e.g., all integers come before all strings, then sort integers numerically, then sort strings lexicographically?)

Without this crucial information, providing a verifiable C code solution is impossible.

If the intent was a *typographical error* and it meant "sort a list of integers" or "sort a list of strings", then a solution would be possible. But "mixed list of integers and strings" is the blocker.
