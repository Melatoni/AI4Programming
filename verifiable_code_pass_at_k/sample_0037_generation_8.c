struct with a tag:** This would allow you to represent elements that could be either an integer or a string.
2.  **Pointers to `void`:** For a truly generic sort function (like `qsort`), but then the comparison logic becomes complex and requires type information to be passed around.
3.  **Separate arrays:** One for integers, one for strings, and sort them independently.

None of these approaches directly fit the "mixed list" concept in a way that allows for a straightforward, single-function implementation that sorts *both* types together based on some arbitrary comparison rule (e.g., "all integers before all strings, then integers sorted numerically, strings sorted lexicographically").

**Why this is difficult/impossible to verify as a single function with Frama-C:**

*   **Mixed Types:** C is statically typed. You cannot have an array `int_or_string arr[]` where elements are sometimes `int` and sometimes `char*`.
*   **Comparison Logic:** How do you compare an `int` with a `char*`? Or an `int` with another `int`? Or a `char*` with another `char*`? This requires complex dispatching logic that would likely involve function pointers or a tagged union, making the ACSL specification extremely intricate for a generic sort.
*   **String Handling:** Strings are `char*`, requiring memory management and `strcmp` for comparison. Frama-C's WP plugin has limited support for reasoning about arbitrary memory contents pointed to by `char*` and the behavior of `strcmp` without extensive axiomatic definitions.
*   **Generic Sorting:** A generic sort function (like `qsort`) takes `void *base` and a `compare` function pointer. Specifying the behavior of such a function using ACSL is a very advanced topic, often requiring a ghost model of the array and its properties.

**Conclusion:**

Given the constraints of Frama-C/ACSL (no standard libraries, focus on C semantics), a function that "sorts a mixed list of integers and strings" as a single, generic operation is not practically implementable or verifiable in a meaningful way within the specified framework.

If the problem intended something like "Given an array of structs, where each struct contains a type tag and a union for the value (int or string), sort this array," that would be a more precise and potentially verifiable problem, but it requires a much more detailed problem description and specific comparison rules.

**Therefore, I cannot provide a solution that meets the requirements for "sorting a mixed list of integers and strings" within the strict Frama-C/ACSL verification paradigm.** The problem statement needs to be significantly refined to be solvable.
