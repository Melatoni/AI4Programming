int` types have fixed precision. Also, "odd bits" could mean:
1. Bits at odd positions (e.g., bit 1, bit 3, bit 5, ...), assuming 0-indexed bits from the LSB.
2. Bits whose *value* is odd (which doesn't make sense for setting bits).

Given the context of Frama-C and bitwise operations, interpretation (1) is the most probable. Furthermore, "set all odd bits of a given number" implies modifying the *input* number, which is usually done by returning a new number with those bits set, or by passing a pointer to modify in-place. For simplicity and verifiability, we will assume it means "return a new number where all odd-indexed bits are set to 1, and even-indexed bits retain their original value."

We'll assume a standard 32-bit `int` for `n`. The maximum bit index would be 31.

  // Rule I.1: No standard library includes.

  // Axiomatic block for recursive logic if needed, but for simple bitwise,
  // it might not be strictly necessary, or can be inlined.
  // For setting all odd bits, we can construct a mask.
  // A 32-bit integer has bits from 0 to 31.
  // Odd bits are 1, 3, 5, ..., 31.
  // The mask for these bits is 0xAAAAAAAA (binary 10101010...1010).

  // Rule II.5: Prevent Runtime Errors.
  // For bitwise operations on `int`, typically no overflow unless shifting
  // by an amount greater than or equal to the bit width.
  // Here, the mask is a constant, and `|` operation doesn't overflow.

  // If `k` is odd, then the `k`-th bit of `result` is 1.
  // If `k` is even, then the `k`-th bit of `result` is the same as the `k`-th bit of `n`.
