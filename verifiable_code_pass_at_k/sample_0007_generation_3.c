The problem description involves regular expressions and string manipulation using them. Frama-C/ACSL does not have built-in support for regex engines or complex string processing beyond basic character arrays. Therefore, it's impossible to provide a Frama-C verifiable solution for "finding words using regex" as described.

To provide a verifiable solution, the problem needs to be rephrased to fit within the capabilities of Frama-C and ACSL, which primarily deal with integer arithmetic, array bounds, and pointer safety.

**Revised Problem (Example, if I were to rephrase it to be verifiable):**

"Write a C function `count_long_words` that takes a null-terminated character array (string) and a minimum length `min_len`. The function should count how many 'words' in the string have a length of at least `min_len`. A 'word' is defined as a contiguous sequence of alphabetic characters (a-z, A-Z). Words are separated by non-alphabetic characters or the beginning/end of the string."

If you can provide a problem description that fits the Frama-C/ACSL paradigm (e.g., array manipulations, integer algorithms, simple string properties), I would be happy to provide a fully verifiable solution according to the rules.
