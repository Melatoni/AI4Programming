char)?
    *   Is it an array of structs, where each struct contains a word and its count?
    *   What is the maximum size of the dictionary?
    *   What are the constraints on word length?
2.  **How are "words" represented?**
    *   Are they null-terminated C strings?
    *   Are they guaranteed to be ASCII?
3.  **What does "count the most common words" mean?**
    *   Do I need to find *the* single most common word?
    *   Do I need to find the top `N` most common words? If so, what is `N`?
    *   If words have the same count, how should ties be handled (e.g., lexicographically)?
    *   What is the return type of the function?
        *   An `int` representing the count of the most common word?
        *   A pointer to the most common word string?
        *   An array of pointers to the top `N` words?
        *   A struct containing the word and its count?
4.  **How are counts determined?**
    *   Is the input dictionary already pre-processed with counts?
    *   Does the function need to *calculate* the counts itself by iterating through a list of raw words? This would imply managing a dynamic structure or a fixed-size frequency map, which is very complex for Frama-C.

**Example of a more specific problem statement that *could* be verified:**

"Given an array of `N` `char*` strings (representing words) and an array of `N` `int` values (representing their respective counts, already pre-calculated), find the index of the word with the highest count. If multiple words have the same highest count, return the index of the first one encountered."

Without such specific details, I cannot produce a verifiable C code with ACSL. Please provide a more precise problem description.
