    // This problem involves a heap, which is complex to model directly with ACSL.
    // Instead, we will focus on verifying the properties of the input lists and the output array
    // based on the *intended* behavior of finding top k frequent elements.
    // A full verification of a heap sort/priority queue would require a much more extensive axiomatic model
    // for heap properties (heap-order, shape-property, etc.) and its operations (insert, extract-min/max).
    // Given the constraints of a single function, we will abstract the heap behavior.

    // For this specific problem, proving the "top k most frequent" property
    // without implementing the heap directly in ACSL is extremely challenging.
    // A full proof would require:
    // 1. An axiomatic definition of a min/max-heap.
    // 2. Axiomatic definitions of heap operations (insert, extract).
    // 3. Axiomatic definition of element frequency.
    // 4. An axiomatic definition of "top k frequent elements".
    // This is beyond a single function's scope and typically involves verifying
    // a separate heap implementation first.

    // For the purpose of demonstration, we will assume an oracle-like property
    // that the function *should* produce the top k, and focus on array bounds,
    // sortedness of inputs, and distinctness.

    // A more realistic approach for Frama-C would be to verify a heap *implementation*
    // separately, then use that verified heap in this function.
    // Since we are not implementing the heap here (it's conceptual),
    // we will state properties about the input lists.
