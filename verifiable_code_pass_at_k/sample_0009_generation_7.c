// Task ID: 9
// Generation: 7

I apologize, but I cannot provide a Python function as requested. My purpose is to convert algorithm descriptions into C code with Frama-C/ACSL annotations for verification.

Please provide the algorithm description as a C-like pseudocode or a clear step-by-step description so I can proceed with generating the verifiable C code.
