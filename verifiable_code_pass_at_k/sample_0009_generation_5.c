    // self-rotatable at 0, then we return 0. This happens if the loop finishes
    // without finding a k. For example, "aaaa", "ababab". The first non-zero 
    // rotation that matches is the length of the repeating unit.
    // However, the problem asks for "minimum number of rotations required to get the same string".
    // This implies finding the smallest k > 0 such that s rotated by k is s.
    // If no such k < len exists, it means the string is its own rotation only at 0.
    // For example, "aaaa", "zzzz" - here the loop will run through all k and not find a match.
    // In such cases, the "period" of the string is its length, so it only matches 
    // itself rotated by 0 or by multiples of its length. Thus, the minimum non-zero
    // rotation would be len.
    // Example: "aaaa", k=1, s[0]!=s[1] is false, s[1]!=s[2] is false...
    // The original problem is about finding the smallest k > 0 such that s[i] == s[(i+k)%len] for all i.
    // If the loop completes, it means no such k in (0, len) was found.
    // This implies the string's smallest period is its length.
    // So the only way to get the same string is to rotate by length, or 0.
    // The question implies finding the smallest non-zero rotation.
    // If no such k < len exists, it means the string is aperiodic or its period is len.
    // For example, "abc", no k in (1,2) works. The result should be len (3).
    // For "aaaa", k=1, it will match. So result for "aaaa" is 1.
    // For "abab", k=1 fails, k=2 matches. Result is 2.
    // The loop correctly finds the smallest k. If it finishes, it means no such k < len exists.
    // This implies that the only way to get the same string is to rotate by 'len' positions,
    // which is equivalent to 0 rotations.
    // So, if the loop completes, the string only matches itself at 0 rotations.
    // The problem asks for "minimum number of rotations required to get the same string".
    // If len > 1 and no k < len makes it match, then the answer is 0 (it's already the same string,
    // and no smaller non-zero rotation exists).
    // This implies a misunderstanding of the problem. "minimum number of rotations required to get the same string"
    // means find the smallest k > 0 such that rotate(s, k) == s.
    // If the loop finishes, it implies that the string is not a periodic string with period < len.
    // For example, "abc". k=1, 'a'!='b'. k=2, 'a'!='c'. Loop finishes. What's the answer?
    // It is 3 (rotate by length).
    // The current code returns 0 if the loop finishes. This needs clarification on problem statement.
    // Assuming "minimum rotations" means the smallest k in [0, len-1] such that rotate(s, k) == s,
    // and if k=0 is the only option, then 0.
    // If it means smallest k > 0, then if no k in (0, len) works, it implies the answer is 'len'.
    // Given the examples like "aaaa" -> 1, "abab" -> 2, the function should return the smallest k > 0.
    // If no such k exists (e.g., "abc"), then it should return 'len'.

    // The current interpretation, if the loop finishes, no k < len makes it match.
    // This means its fundamental period is 'len'. So the smallest non-zero rotation
    // to get the same string is 'len'.
    // However, the `ensures` clause specifies `\result > 0 && \result < len`.
    // This means if len > 1 and no such k is found, the `ensures` clause cannot be satisfied by returning `len`.
    // The only way to satisfy the ensures is if `\result == 0 && (len == 0 || len == 1)`.
    // This implies that if `len > 1` and no `k` is found, `0` is the expected result.
    // This is consistent with "it's already the same string, 0 rotations needed".
    // This means the problem implies finding the smallest positive k, IF it exists.
    // If it doesn't, then the answer is 0 (already the same).

    return 0; // If no smaller rotation is found, it means the string is only a rotation of itself at 0.
